Logistic Regression vs kNN using Orange Data Mining
# Machine Learning Model Comparison using Orange

## Objective
To compare Logistic Regression and kNN using Orange Data Mining.

## Workflow
Dataset → Data Table → Select Columns → 
Logistic Regression & kNN → Test & Score → Predictions

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

## Evaluation
Used Test & Score widget to compare model performance.

## Key Learning
Different algorithms behave differently on the same dataset.
Model comparison is essential before selecting the final model.
